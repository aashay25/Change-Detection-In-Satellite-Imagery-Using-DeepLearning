# Change-Detection-In-Satellite-Imagery-Using-DeepLearning

#### This was an industrial project which I did as a part of my B.tech project at Government Organization BISAG-N (MeitY, Govt. of India).
#### Developed deep learning models for satellite image change detection, leveraged 1000+ high-resolution images to deliver precise visualization and quantification of affected regions.
####  Streamlined image analysis workflows by building automation pipelines, reducing turnaround time by 60% and supporting large-scale monitoring operations.
